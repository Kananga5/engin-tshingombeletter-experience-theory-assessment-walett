-explanation: calculation impedance of power source the up streav network the power supply transformers as well as of the electrical lines 
Problem consider a 20kv network that supplies a HV / LV substation via 2 m overhead  line and MVA generator that supplies in parallel the busbare of the same substation two 1000kva parallel connected transformers euply the LV,busbar which in turn supply 29out gears to 20 motor including the one supplying motor .all motor are rate 50kw all connections cable are identical and all motor are running when  the fault occurs the isc3a d up value must be calculated at the variouse fault location indicated in the network diagram.
-point A on the HV busbars with a negligible impedance.
-point B on the LV busbar,at a distance of meter from the transformer.
-Point c  on the busbar of an LV su distribution board .
-point D at the terminal of motor Mthen the reverse current of the motor must be calculated at C and B .

-short circuit: condition the load will be served by a 1500kva transformer at 480,3 phase through a single motor control centre the fault current availability from the utilities on the source side of transformer is unknown ,the transformer is approximately,75% of the rating of the transformer note that standard transformer impedance is valued at +1-7,5% of nominal , therefore a conservative calculation the lowest impedance should be used 
5,75%((100%-7,5%)÷100=5,32%
-the current flowing during a fault at any point in an electrical system is limited by the impedance of the circuit and equipment from the source or source to the point where the fault has occurred for these simplified calculation we will assume that only source are the transformer and the motor connected to the system the motor are connected in parallel with the transformer as an impedance with an infinite bus as the source of the fault current 
- short circuit current= driving voltage /total impedance (ohm,
A point -to- calculation of short circuit current available at any point can using it the basic used per unit calcul short circuit 
-value in electric power circuit the reactance of the utility systeme must be assumed  zero ,and the following 
-approximate transformer per - unit ,Z=(%Z)(base KVA )÷(100)(transfo KVA)
Base KVA = transfo KVA

-7.9.explain: .the bits and pieces of a bit .you don't have to make your robot body elaborate to make it Google body elaborate make a simple and shirdy body by using common tools and readily available material simple can building square shaped body more easily .
-introducing rover the robot .
-fairly simple robot that gives perfect intro to robot building just staring .
,- in the basic rover ,use two small DC gear motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair of wired switches gear motor motor are like regular motor , except they also of gears that make the motor more ,propelling the switch down up and down its lot more fun that if sound especially if have car dog to chose around don't worry no animal will be harmed during this project .
- the advance rover use a microcontroller , specifically e basic stamp 2,to building self contained autonomous robot , with verst your program the  microcontroller for what you won't rover to do this smart rover uses specialised motor that you have to take operate and and modify you ,
,-;preparing to building the bot .
Befot you can drill your first Hade or fasten your first but ,you need to layout design of your robot ,acquire LL the material and sort.
 
-first get your self a template.
Although you use a circuit schematic for simple projects ,you graduate to something called ,a cutting and drilling template for making a robot this template  as the layout for your robot  draw the layout scale ,that the size and shape that you want the finished piece to ,-be-on a piece of paper.
 
- the cuttt and drilling template for river two - deck tablet robot the dimensions used .in this template are measure.
Inch the template include the two body piece we call decks ,like the decks of a ship ,there s a bottom deck and top deck ,you attach ,the motor wheel to the bottom decks ,top deck is left free for future enhancement such an add ..
 
 
Draw ,
---------------
 
Gathering your material rudimentary construction skill to build rover using .
 
- 1/4inch hardwood plywood ,a good choice ,is 5-ply our craft plywood available at any hobby store
-1/4 inch rigid plastic you can this plastic Stores.
- if you re nor careful , acrylic can shaftle  when you re drilling or cutting IL.
- acrylic drill tools Mather quickly
-acrylix  generate a ton of static electricity.
-gating  piece : machine screws size.
When using stand off as rises the minimum length that you can use ,2/2 inch ,1-or,1.1/2 inch standoff work.
- if you re using machine screw distance between deck piece plus thickness of the deck piece , material thickness of the retaining nut ,want inch. Of clearance and you 're using 2/4inch thick wook ,or PVC ,the machine screws must .
 
- building the body of the bot plan material in hand actually start construction,so put on you your hard ,and ,oh don't forget .
 
- cutting and drilling the piece of robot body first step building process is to use the robot layout from , fig ,,15-1to drill holes for mounting parts and the cut the deck piece .
 
- layout the holes and cutting dimension from the template ,15-1 directly wood or plastic material on better yet draw the m first on a piece of papper the tape paper over the wood or plastic material.
 
-when all look right ,drill holes for rover using a 2/8,inch drill bik , not drill Manuel,drill press Helt accurate holes.
 
-after you finish drilling cut the piece to size used hacsiw ,coping saw jigsaw ,band saw it prove control
 
-sand Draw the cornea of the piece to produce bevels edge more sharp angle at each corner cut rover .
 
 
- Assembling and mounting the motor set a side the body piece for now and turn to assembling the two gear motor you put these motor together by following the instructions your motor Phillips screw drivers to assemble the motor  note that the screw driver does come in the kit si you  need to buy one if you don't already have need small hex key wrench ,attach motor ..

Yours sincerely,

Savings tips
 
lighting
1.       Replace all your CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) with energy saving LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) - switch off lights in all unoccupied rooms.
2.       Install day-night sensors on outdoor security lights.
3.       Ensure that your oven door is closed until the food is done - opening and closing it wastes energy.

-short circuit: condition the load will be served by a 1500kva transformer at 480,3 phase through a single motor control centre the fault current availability from the utilities on the source side of transformer is unknown ,the transformer is approximately,75% of the rating of the transformer note that standard transformer impedance is valued at +1-7,5% of nominal , therefore a conservative calculation the lowest impedance should be used 
5,75%((100%-7,5%)÷100=5,32%
-the current flowing during a fault at any point in an electrical system is limited by the impedance of the circuit and equipment from the source or source to the point where the fault has occurred for these simplified calculation we will assume that only source are the transformer and the motor connected to the system the motor are connected in parallel with the transformer as an impedance with an infinite bus as the source of the fault current

-introducing rover the robot .
-fairly simple robot that gives perfect intro to robot building just staring .
,- in the basic rover ,use two small DC gear motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair motor to control it's movement ,by using a pair of wired switches gear motor motor are like regular motor , except they also of gears that make the motor more ,propelling the switch down up and down its lot more fun that if sound especially if have car dog to chose around don't worry no animal will be harmed during this project .
- the advance rover use a microcontroller , specifically e basic stamp 2,to building self contained autonomous robot , with verst your program the  microcontroller for what you won't rover to do this smart rover uses specialised motor that you have to take operate and and modify you ,
,-;preparing to building the bot .
Befot you can drill your first Hade or fasten your first but ,you need to layout design of your robot ,acquire LL the material and sort.
 
-first get your self a template.
Although you use a circuit schematic for simple projects ,you graduate to something called ,a cutting and drilling template for making a robot this template  as the layout for your robot  draw the layout scale ,that the size and shape that you want the finished piece to ,-be-on a piece of paper.
 
- the cuttt and drilling template for river two - deck tablet robot the dimensions used .in this template are measure.

Yours sincerely,

Savings tips
 
lighting
1.       Replace all your CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps) with energy saving LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) - switch off lights in all unoccupied rooms.
2.       Install day-night sensors on outdoor security lights.
3.       Ensure that your oven door is closed until the food is done - opening and closing it wastes energy.

Improve the Education and Training System for Future Engineers
I am a passionate advocate for education and training in electrical engineering and related fields, inspired by my daughters and a mentor who is a university professor. Our educational system is critically under-equipped for teaching emerging technologies. Our young learners, particularly in technical fields, are facing challenges because of an antiquated school curriculum and lack of hands-on skills. This is a call on our educational institutions and governing bodies to increase the emphasis on practical, vocational and technological training, particularly in engineering disciplines.Engineering is a vital profession that shapes the world around us. Despite the growing demand, fewer young people are choosing engineering as a career. According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, there will be a 4% growth in engineering jobs over the next decade, but educational institutions are struggling to keep up with these changes. Our educational system falls short on developing the required skill sets.Moreover, complaints and legal challenges within the education system are rising, distracting from the ultimate goal of providing quality education to our young minds. According to a report by the National School Boards Association, legal battles related to education have increased by 12% in the last five years. This raises questions about the efficiency and effectiveness of our education system.It's time to revolutionize our technical and engineering education. Let’s empower future engineers with the educational framework that nurtures their innovative minds, provides them with the necessary hands-on skills, and equips them with the knowledge they need to build a brighter future for all of us. Sign and support this petition and help us to bring a positive change in our education system.
